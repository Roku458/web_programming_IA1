                    My personal motto “consistency over intensity” is something I try to keep in mind whenever 
                    I’m doing something weather big or small. Nothing happens overnight, it takes effort and time 
                    to excel in all things.

                Despite their limitations, personality assessments are a terrific way to improve hiring practices and 
                guarantee that the right candidates are placed in the correct positions. As everyone has different traits 
                and quirks personalities that make them who they are. They can help you understand yourself and others, which 
                not only make your personal life more effective and productive but also your workplace and other areas. In my case, 
                I think that the personality test has validity especially this one as it captures some aspects of my personality very well. 
                And in knowing my personality, or at least a rough estimation of it I can use this knowledge to my advantage in various 
                aspects of my life.
