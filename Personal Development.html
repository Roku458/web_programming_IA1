            <h3 align="center">Personal strengths</h3>
            <p align="center">
                My personals strengths are my honesty, kindness and my work ethic. From a young 
                age I was taught to be kind to everyone regardless of whether they like me or not 
                and it take a lot to be able to do that, sometimes I fail but I look back on those 
                moments and learn from them. Similarly, I was also taught to be honest as a child, 
                as did everyone, but seeing my remodels showing honesty even when it would benefit 
                them to hide the truth really left an impact on me, hence I strive to do the same. 
                My work ethic is strong, I developed it in school as a response to all the work and 
                pressure I faced. Over the years I try to work on these strengths as much as possible 
                by trying to be as kind aa I can to both strangers and people close to me. I keep my 
                honest to the best of my ability and I work on whatever task I have with maximum effort.

            </font>
            <h3>Summary and Interpretation</h3>
            <p>
                Pillar 4: Achieve Your Goals<br>
                Setting goals entails choosing a destination and creating a strategy to get there. 
                You may create the future you want by setting goals that challenge you and force you to think and act differently. 
                Donâ€™t wait for somebody to create goals for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pillar 5: The Proper Use of Time<br>
                The opportunities that best fit your long-term objectives are the ones you should focus on each day. 
                Instead of simply passing the time, make the most of it. 
                Spend your time on what is important rather than the urgent. 
                The design of our lives can only be done by us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pillar 6: Surround Yourself with the Best People<br>
                Convenience friends. 
                This idea has some appeal. 
                Is it simpler to maintain existing friendships than to make new ones? 
                Successful people seek connections with like-minded individuals who will push, challenge, and inspire them to improve. 
                You must be appealing in order to draw attractive people. 
                not actually, but mentally and in terms of who you are.
                Your attitude is greatly influenced by the people who you associate with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pillar 7: Be a Life-Long Learner<br>
                You educate yourself by doing it yourself. 
                It is what you discover along the journey that will keep you evolving and expanding. 
                Being focused on continual learning can help you stand out from the crowd because most individuals don't do it.
                Wealth begins with education. 
                Health begins with education. 
                Spirituality begins with learning. 
                The magical process all starts with searching and learning. 
                The majority of life is experienced after formal education. 
                Therefore, the remaining steps are up to you.
            </p>
            <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
            <p>
                I have really been inspired by this book and I will try to apply these pillars in my life. 
                I will do this by setting goals for my future development, spending my precious time wisely 
                on meaningful things, evaluating the friends I keep and gaining new ones that align with my 
                aspirations, and continue to improve myself through continuous learning.
